## Windows installation guide

Unfortunately there is no official installation guide for Windows environment. We recommend using a virtual Linux environment and following the [Linux instructions](./linux.md).

If you master Rust for Embedded on the Windows environment, please give us a shout, we would highly appreciate your [contribution](../call_for_contribution.md).
