## Glossary

We know how frustating it is sometimes to join a new project or a new community. Most of the time is spent trying to understand what people say, it all sounds very technical. Most of the time it is really nothing difficult, you just need someone to explain it to you once in simple terms.

This page is our attempt to do just that. It hosts a list of library/crate names and their function as well as other jargon we use often.

Let us know if you would like anything added to this list or if an explantion is not clear enough. Feel free to contribute to this list via a pull request.
