# Luos Documentation
Luos is a set of hardware and software libraries, written in Rust, that orchestrates your robotic system. See https://www.luos.io/ for more.

Luos is Open Source (Apache 2.0), you can star, clone and fork it on Github: https://github.com/pollen-robotics/luos

Do not hesitate to join the [community](https://www.luos.io/#pricing) and obtain a [dev board](https://www.luos.io/products/)!

## Get Started

1. [Installation guide](/installation_guide/README.md): setup for Rust for embedded on you computer

2. [Available development boards](/tutorials/00_development_boards.md): select the board that is right for you

3. [Hello world: compile and upload your first program](/tutorials/01_your_first_program.md): learn to toggle a led on an off at the press of a button

4. [Taking a short break, or how to pause your program for a bit](/tutorials/02_blink_an_led.md): learn to blink a led at a defined frequency

5. [Taking a deep breath, using PWM to change led brightness](/tutorials/03_led_brightness_with_pwm.md): learn to use PWM to create a breathing behavior on your led

6. [Reading analog values](/tutorials/04_led_brightness_via_potentiometer.md): learn to read an analog value from a pin, and control led brightness using a potentiometer

7. [Build a remote controlled elastic gun](/tutorials/05_servo_control_via_potentiometer.md): learn to control a servomotor, and create a remotely controlled elastic gun to rule the world
