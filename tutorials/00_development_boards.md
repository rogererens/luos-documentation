## Our development board

We currently only support one board. Here is it:

Isn't it beautiful? Well not really but it will do for now to get you started.

It is called STM32F072B-DISCO. You can buy it on our [website](https://www.luos.io/) to support the project, or directly on one of the many resellers out-there.

Official Luos boards are coming soon, they will be much better and much smaller! The first one will be called the L0, pronounced L-zero:

We expect it to be ready for our first beta testers by end of February. And look, it is already being tested in house:
